### üìù Interpretation of the Histogram
- The majority of cars are priced below a certain threshold.
- There might be some **outliers** (very expensive cars) affecting the distribution.
- This helps us understand the overall price range in the dataset.

### üìù Interpretation of the Scatter Plot
- Typically, cars with **higher mileage** are sold for **lower prices**.
- There are some exceptions where certain cars retain value despite higher mileage.
- Understanding this relationship helps buyers and sellers set realistic expectations.
